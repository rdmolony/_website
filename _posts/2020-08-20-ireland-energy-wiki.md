A website of curated resources to aid Irish energy research.  It tracks tools, models & webmaps and also hosts apps & guides created by the energy-modelling-ireland community.

I initially set it up to share URLs to useful datasets I came across during my research at Codema.  Over time it has grown with the help of energy researchers from across Ireland.
