A curated website of up-to-date Dublin energy webmaps, apps & datasets.

Traditionally Codema's maps and visualisations have been created using QGIS or Excel and published via reports in paper or pdf fromat.  More recently `Tableau`, `Python` and `Github` have enabled the creation and publication of interactive webmaps.  These webmaps enable the presentation of fine-grained data thanks to zoom and mouse-hover functionality, and so can provide useful information about the Dublin energy system at multiple levels (countywide to local authority to small areas or 80-120 dwellings) for multiple users (local authority planners to small energy community mentors and consultants).

The website is open-source on Github and so is open to contributions from anyone interested in sharing their research.
