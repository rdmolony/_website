An interactive web application that models retrofit scenarios on the Dublin building stock.  It enables users to ask questions of the building stock.  If I want to estimate what the cost, BER & emissions impact might be of retrofitting 100,000 homes I can select the corresponding sliders.  If I want to input my own assumptions about the target U-value and the cost of doing so I can also change this in the application.  In this way the model's assumptions are parameterisable.
