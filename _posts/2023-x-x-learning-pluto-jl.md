- Slow startup

  After clicking `Edit or run this notebook` I found it confusing that all notebook outputs disappear ...
  
  It turns out that `Status` shows that dependencies etc are being installed in the background

- Automatic syncing between cells

  Now this is really cool.  I love that it handles updating cells that depend upon other cells for me.  I immediately felt that this should be the behaviour all notebooks exhibit
