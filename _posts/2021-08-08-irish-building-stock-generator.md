An interactive web application that generates a clean Irish residential building stock.  

`ibsg` loads the Building Energy Rating (BER) dataset, filters out erroneous buildings by applying filters, merges the BERs with the complete 2016 Census & fills any unknown buildings with archetypes.

Automating the generation of the Irish building stock allows multiple energy modellers to use the same building stock with the same assumptions.  Keeping it open-source enables them to challenge and feed into the process.
