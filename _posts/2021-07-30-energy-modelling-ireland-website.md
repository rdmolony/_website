A website of curated resources to aid Irish energy research.  It was initially created to track energy datasets on `Github` which is easy to change and so easy to keep up to date.  It has since expanded to include useful tools, webmaps and guides.  It's community-driven so anyone who finds a broken URL or a dataset they think others might find useful can add it themselves on Github, or email their suggestions to the development team.

It has migrated from a `Github` README, to a [`Github Wiki`](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/documenting-your-project-with-wikis/about-wikis), to an [`mkdocs-material`](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) website, and finally to a [`Jekyll`](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/about-github-pages-and-jekyll) website.  `Github Wiki` made the User Interface (UI) cleaner by adding a sidebar of pages, `mkdocs-material` added search capabilities and page-specific sidebars, while `Jekyll` added blogging capabilities on top of all that `mkdocs` had to offer.
