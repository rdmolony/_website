[Orangeworks](https://www.orangeworks.ie/) asked our 8 person Trinity / University of Sao Paolo engineering team "How might we redefine the corporate team building experience for 2030?"  For our troubles we got a free trip to Sao Paulo to hash out ideas and to California to present our findings.

Weirdly, we first considered remote teams which now seems like a winner.  I believe we ruled it out as we didn't want to rely on pure software as a team of mostly mechanical engineers.  We team builded.  We built prototypes including a chess-style board that translated physical game piece movements into actions in a virtual world and physical buttons to play [QWOP](http://www.foddy.net/Athletics.html) collaboratively.  Eventually we converged on a monstrosity that looked fancy, was fun to build and kind of met our brief.

It was a laser cut, computer-vision driven tabletop team building platform.  The table used computer-vision to read the objects placed on top of a transparent board and in response adapted the visuals being projected onto it.
