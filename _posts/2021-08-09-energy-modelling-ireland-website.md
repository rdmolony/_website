A website of curated resources to aid Irish energy research.  I was inspired by [`awesome`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) and [open-sustainable-technology](https://github.com/protontypes/open-sustainable-technology) which host crowd-sourced lists on `Github` which is easy to change and so easy to keep up to date.  It aims to support energy researchers across Ireland by crowd-sourcing data & tutorials.  As the concept grew, researchers from organisations and universities across Ireland started to participate and feed in over monthly network `Microsoft Teams` calls.

Initially the website hosted only URLs to useful datasets but it has since expanded to include useful tools, webmaps, guides and applications.  It's community-driven so anyone who finds a broken URL or a dataset they think others might find useful can add it themselves on Github, or email their suggestions to me.  

It migrated from a `Github` README, to a [`Github Wiki`](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/documenting-your-project-with-wikis/about-wikis), to an [`mkdocs-material`](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) website, and finally to a [`Jekyll`](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/about-github-pages-and-jekyll) website.  `Github Wiki` made the User Interface (UI) cleaner by adding a sidebar of pages, `mkdocs-material` added search capabilities and page-specific sidebars, while `Jekyll` added blogging capabilities on top of all that `mkdocs` had to offer.
